On all action buttons such as Add Customer, Add Task and Log Sales, it does not open a form with placeholding information to fill in, but instead the form View or Edit dependent on what I had opened prior.

In Tasks, align the width of Due Date field and Priority field with the Status field.

Add some modern design to the action buttons to make it more intutive that is a key button: Add Customer, Add Task, Log Sale

Add Category on Sales and add Fake data to them

Drop downs on an entry form has transparent background such as Status, Priority, Category 

Add Date for Sales so in entry, edit, view and in the column 

Add Sorting of each column. Defaults: Customers - Company, Tasks - Due Date / Newest First, Sales - Dates.

Using the existing sorting mechanism, add sorting of the columns on the pages: On Customers - Status and Created, on Tasks - Status, Priority and Assigned To, on Log Sales - Customer, Product, Category, Amount, Date and Status

Add a search bar below the action buttons Add Customer/Create Task and Log Sales where you can search for any data in the table.
Add Filters in the columns that uses sorting. For instance on Sales: Amount levels <$1.000, $1.001 - $3.000, $3.001-$5.000 etc. Date filter on Year and/or Month. Status on the different status. Categories. Assigned To.
In the dropdown list of filters, add a tick mark toggle to choose one or multiple filters within each Column
