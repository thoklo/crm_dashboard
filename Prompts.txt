On all action buttons such as Add Customer, Add Task and Log Sales, it does not open a form with placeholding information to fill in, but instead the form View or Edit dependent on what I had opened prior.

In Tasks, align the width of Due Date field and Priority field with the Status field.

Add some modern design to the action buttons to make it more intutive that is a key button: Add Customer, Add Task, Log Sale

Add Category on Sales and add Fake data to them

Drop downs on an entry form has transparent background such as Status, Priority, Category 

Add Date for Sales so in entry, edit, view and in the column 

Add Sorting of each column. Defaults: Customers - Company, Tasks - Due Date / Newest First, Sales - Dates.

Using the existing sorting mechanism, add sorting of the columns on the pages: On Customers - Status and Created, on Tasks - Status, Priority and Assigned To, on Log Sales - Customer, Product, Category, Amount, Date and Status

Add Filters in the columns that uses sorting. For instance on Sales: Amount levels <$1.000, $1.001 - $3.000, $3.001-$5.000 etc. Date filter on Year and/or Month. Status on the different status. Categories. Assigned To.

Please create a landing page for this CRM dashboard. It shall have two modes. 1. The existing setup with Fake Data. 2. All existing functions, but using real data, so not using the fake data function. Update the code accordingly

Add two buttons on all Edit and View forms that says Previous and Next, that goes to the next entry in the table


Add a search bar below the action buttons Add Customer/Create Task and Log Sales where you can search for any data in the table.

DATABASE

The application is designed with a clean separation between the data layer and the UI through the dataService.ts, which supports two modes:

"Demo" mode: Uses generated data with faker.js (currently working)
"Production" mode: Expected to connect to a real API server (currently not implemented)
You have several options to implement the "real" data mode:

Supabase Option:
Easy to set up, provides a PostgreSQL database with built-in API
Has good TypeScript support and real-time capabilities
Can be self-hosted or use their cloud service

MongoDB + API Option:
Set up MongoDB locally or use MongoDB Atlas
Create a simple Express/Node.js API server
Store your data in MongoDB collections (tasks, customers, sales)

Local File Storage + Next.js API Routes:
Use Next.js API routes (add them in src/app/api/)
Store data in local JSON or SQLite files
No need for external database or server

Here's what I recommend based on your setup:

Option 1: Next.js API Routes with Local JSON Storage This would be the quickest to implement and requires no external dependencies:

Create API routes in your Next.js app
Store data in JSON files
Use the existing dataService.ts structure

Set up Next.js API routes with local JSON storage (simplest)
Set up Supabase integration (more robust, includes auth)
Set up MongoDB with a simple Express API (traditional approach)
Something else you have in mind


Add Delete button on the forms to delete an entry

Adding sales in Powershell
$body = @{
    customer = 'Test Customer'
    product = 'Test Product'
    amount = 1000
    status = 'Pending'
    category = 'Software'
    date = '2025-05-26T12:00:00.000Z'
} | ConvertTo-Json;
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/api/sales' -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

The dashboard page should now work correctly with both fake and real data sources. The key changes made are:

Added proper TypeScript interfaces for the stats and chart data
Added error handling and proper loading states
Using the new data service response format that includes error and loading states
Using the LoadingState and ErrorState components for better UX
Using Promise.all for parallel data fetching
Proper error aggregation from all data sources
Type-safe handling of the data
The page will now:

Show a loading state while fetching data
Show an error state if something goes wrong
Display the dashboard normally when data is loaded successfully
Work seamlessly with both fake and real data sources
You should now be able to:

Start on the landing page
Choose between fake or real data
See the dashboard load properly with the chosen data source
Switch between data sources using the Settings component

Proper error handling
Loading states
Type-safe operations
Clear navigation structure
